The marminino is an open hardware fork from the Nanino project, initially made by Johan von Konon, and updated by Brad Luyster.The project goals are:\r\n\r\n* Single side PCB, who can be made for beginners and still with great results (big traces, with big spaces between).\r\n* Minimal components, just the essencial. \r\n* Some capacitors for a better battery powered experience.\r\n* Jumper for selectiong the power source (FTDI or Batteries).\r\n* Mounting holes attach a 4 AA battery support. \r\n* Better led position.\r\n* New component organisation.\r\n* New switch position\r\n* Two new female bar pins for easy prototyping with or without mini breadboard.\r\n* Complete information about pins on silk screen.\r\n\r\nThe board was created using DipTrace software, who is freeely available for small projects.\r\n\r\n* The list of components:\r\n* 1x single sided PCB board (etch, mill or order)\r\n* 1x ATmega328P (28 pin DIL)\r\n* 1x IC socket 28 pin DIL (optional)\r\n* 2x 6×1 0.1” female pin header\r\n* 2x 8×1 0.1” female pin header\r\n* 2x 5×1 0.1” female pin header (optional)\r\n* 1x 6×1 0.1” pin header (FTDI connector)\r\n* 1x 3×1 0.1” pin header (Power jumper)\r\n* 1x jumper\r\n* 1x 10k resistor (reset pull up – 1/4W)\r\n* 2x 1k resistor (power and pin 13 LED – 1/4W)\r\n* 1x yellow 3mm LED (pin 13)\r\n* 1x green 3mm LED (power)\r\n* 1x 16 MHz crystal (0.2” pitch)\r\n* 2x 22pF decoupling caps\r\n* 1x 6mm miniature switch (reset)\r\n* 3x 0.1uF decoupling cap 0.1/0.2”\r\n* 1x 1uF cap 0.1/0.2” (optional if not using batteries)\r\n* 1x AA battery support (optional if not using batteries) \r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
